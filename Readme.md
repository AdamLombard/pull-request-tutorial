# Pull Request Tutorial

## What is a Pull Request?
From Github's [Using Pull Requests Page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Pull Requests are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the [Shared Repository Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#article-platform-nav), where everyone shares a single repository and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. Many open source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.

Here's [an example pull request](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1051) from jQuery's github repo.

## Creating a Pull Request

There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:

1. Pull Request from a [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Pull Request from a branch within a repository

Here we are going to focus on 2.
